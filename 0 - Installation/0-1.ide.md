# Installation

## What

Install a community version Visual Studio

## Why

If you're having is issues installing this, your computer might not be able to get you through this.

Windows might be the affordable choice, but you will need a "not expensive and not dirt cheap" PC.

Dear **Mac users**,

Mac might be one of the best environment to program... I developed this with people who don't have a one.
