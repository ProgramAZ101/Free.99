Difficulties:

- Hard to understand
  - Learn to "read between the ~~accents~~ lines" (understand the attempt)
- Outdated version of VS
  - Some steps are now different ([creating table](https://youtu.be/3lmHYKbuFIA?t=44))


#### Alternative

For Mac users:

this is not the exact same project, you will need to do twice the homework:

- follow the Mac Video
- follow the Windows Video
  - you will need to set up database, the Mac video didn't go that deep

The original goal was to make the 1st lesson challenging, but not that much.
Unfortunately we haven't come across better "Free" information


### Homeworks

We're going to turn the application into a secret journal

#### - Password input

People can see the password being typed.
Make the Password behave like secret field

#### - Add widgets to the 2nd page

- A Label that says `Secret:`
- A **Textarea** that takes multiple lines (not a like the `username` field)
- A button `Load Secret` on the bottom left
- A button `Save Secret` on the bottom right


#### - Add a `message` column in the database

refer to the video

#### - Add functionalities

- `Load Secret` will grab value from the database and put them in the `Textarea`

    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerName, City, Country FROM Customers;
    ```

- `Save Secret` will grab the text from the `Textarea` and store them in the DB

    ```sql
    UPDATE Customers
    SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City = 'Frankfurt'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1; 
    ```
