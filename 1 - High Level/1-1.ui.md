Difficulties:

- Hard to understand
  - Learn to read between the ~~accents~~ lines
- Outdated version of VS
  - Some steps are now different ([creating table](https://youtu.be/3lmHYKbuFIA?t=44))

### Homeworks

We're going to turn the application into a secret journal

#### - Password input

People can see the password being typed.
Make the Password behave like secret field

#### - Add widgets to the 2nd page

- A Label that says `Secret:`
- A **Textarea** that takes multiple lines (not a like the `username` field)
- A button `Load Secret` on the bottom left
- A button `Save Secret` on the bottom right


#### - Add a `message` column in the database

refer to the video

#### - Add functionalities

- `Load Secret` will grab value from the database and put them in the `Textarea`

    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerName, City, Country FROM Customers;
    ```

- `Save Secret` will grab the text from the `Textarea` and store them in the DB

    ```sql
    UPDATE Customers
    SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City = 'Frankfurt'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1; 
    ```
