# Free.99 

Free resources collected over the years, to help others learn to program

## The Approach

As time go on, the instruction will be less and less
(to let you stand on your own and because this need to be all typed out)

### Practice before Theory:

- First stumble your way around and follow/copy.
- Then you create something, however your mind clicked.
- That way, when you're sitting through the long videos, your mind is working.

You follow to the best of your ability.

Some of these resources are meant to test your capacity to be resourceful, creativity, and think outside the box.

## The Key

Any seasoned programmer will admit there's nothing special about some of these resources.

What has been observed from developing this curriculum is to...

> 
> If this is not for you
> 
> You will struggle
> 
> If this is for you...
> 
> You will struggle, but you'll have fun

Have fun!


## The Help

I can provide you with 2

- Putting this together
- "Put regular time aside"

No more help, that's why it's free

### The order is of importance

Follow it... or not, that's up to you


## The Catch

> I've thought myself on free information, but I'm aware **it's not easy**.
>
> If you need a course to get started, **you will need someone to help**.


## The Reality

It's free because I believe you will need help.
